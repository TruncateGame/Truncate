      Congratulations on mastering the basics of Truncate!
      
      The advanced tutorial will cover more complex situations and strategies.

      You'll notice that the board has an uneven shape, this is typical of a Truncate puzzle.

      We're still playing as the blue player, who started at the bottom of the board.

      On small irregular boards it's easy to run out of space.

      Anywhere we play we'll either lose letters or make a vulnerable invalid word.

      To play for time and minimise the damage, we can sacrifice our A.

      At the same time we can get rid of a useless Q from our hand.

    you: "Q -> 3,5"
    gets: "E"

      Unfortunately we didn't get a new letter that can extend RATE.

      Let's see if our opponent takes advantage of the space we gave them.
    computer: "P -> 3,5"
    gets: "I"

      Luckily, we can just play GEAR in the same spot it was in before.
    you: "A -> 3,4"
    gets: "I"

  - description: |-
      We just got an I, which means we can play IRATE.

      Let's see what the opponent does.
    computer: "I -> 3,6"
    gets: "I"

  - description: |-
      The computer wasn't able to defend fig.

      So now we can play IRATE and beat them back.

    you: "Q -> 3,5"
    gets: "E"
