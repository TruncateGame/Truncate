              Previously, attackers needed to be two letters longer than a defender to win.

              Now, they only have to be one letter longer.
          - message: |-
              This means a valid word beats any shorter word.
          - description: |-
              In this battle, "LARGE" will now beat "TINY", since it is longer by one.

              Try playing an "L" to defeat the opponent's word.
            you: "L -> 8,3"
            gets: "F"
          - message: |-
              You'll also notice that a lot of the art has changed!

              The biggest visual change is that docks have been replaced by artifacts.
          - description: |-
              You now start the game by placing a tile adjacent to your artifact.

              On this board, your artifact is at the bottom left of the board. Try playing an 'E' there.
            you: "E -> 7,1"
            gets: "S"
          - message: |-
              What happens when you touch an opponent's artifact has also changed.

              Now, you win the game by touching your opponent's artifact, or their town.
          - message: |-
              Towns and artifacts have the same win condition.

              To win, your word must be valid, otherwise your word will be destroyed.
          - description: |-
              Try playing an 'S' to attack their artifact with 'SLATE'.
            you: "S -> 5,7"
            gets: "E"
          - message: |-
              You won the game, without having to touch their town.
          - end_message: |-
              That's all of the changes!
