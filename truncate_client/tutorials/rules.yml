            We'll demonstrate each rule by having you play example scenarios.

            In Truncate, players take turns to place a tile on the board.

        - message: |-
            In this game you are playing as blue.

            You can tell which colour you're playing by the colour of the tiles in your hand.

        - description: |-
            You start the game by placing tiles beside your dock.

            Your dock is at the bottom left of the board. Try playing an 'M' there.
          you: "M -> 7,1"
          gets: "E"

        - description: |-
            Now it's your opponent's turn.

            Click Next to see their first move.
          computer: "D -> 4,7"
          gets: "R"

        - description: |-
            Once you've placed a tile, you can place tiles beside your dock or your existing tiles.

            Try playing an 'A' beside the 'M' you just played.
          you: "A -> 7,2"
          gets: "E"

            To win, touch your opponent's town with a valid word.

            Notice that your dock is on the right of the board, and your opponent's town and dock are on the left.

        - description: |-
            Place a 'G' to form the word 'GROWING', which will touch your opponent's town, and win the game.
          you: "G -> 7,5"
          gets: "E"

        - message: |-
            Since "GROWING" is a valid word touching your opponent's town, you win the game.

            To win, the word touching your opponent's town has to be valid, but the rest of your words don't.

            You will win if you play 'R' to form "YOUR", even though you have invalid words like "AXQT" on your board.
          you: "R -> 1,2"
          gets: "E"

        - description: |-
            You can swap by clicking one and then the other, or by dragging one onto the other.

            Try turning "VALDI" into "VALID" by swapping the 'D' and 'I'. Note, you can't swap between the board and your hand.
          you: "4,5 -> 5,5"
          gets: "_"
        - message: |-
            This used up your turn, but now your word is valid!

            You can't swap twice in a row, so your next turn would have to place a tile.

            Your opponent's word "NIVALDI" is invalid, so you can defeat it with a valid word.

            Only words touching another player's words are involved in a battle. This means you can win battles even though your board contains invalid words.

            Try playing "TO" against your opponent's "FT".
          you: "T -> 5,3"

            Long valid words beat short words in a battle. "LARGE" is longer than "TINY" and would win in a battle.

            Try playing an "L" to defeat your opponent's word.
          you: "L -> 8,3"
          gets: "F"

        - message: |-
            "EQUAL" was valid, but was the same length as "ALIKE". Since it was the attacker, the attack failed.

            Often multiple defenders will be involved in a battle.

            In Truncate, the weakest defender determines the outcome of a battle.
        - message: |-
            This means that even if you have a strong word on the board, it can be undermined by one of your weaker words.
        - description: |-
            For example, you can attack "PAIR" with "TRAP". Normally, you wouldn't win due to the defender's advantage.
            
            However, since you're also attacking "PI", the battle will be in your favour.
          you: "T -> 6,4"
          gets: "E"
        - message: |-
            "PI" was destroyed since it was shorter than "TRAP", but "PAIR" was not. Even though you won the battle, you only destroyed words that were weaker than your attack.
        - description: |-
            Since the 'P' in "PAIR" was also in "PI", it was destroyed, shortening "PAIR" to "AIR".

            Now your opponent will take their turn.

            Now you can attack your opponent's invalid word "QXA".

            You could play "RE" (the musical note), or you could play "ERA" and attack "CALF" at the same time.
        - description: |-
            Since the weakest defender determines the battle, you will win an attack against both "QXA" and "CALF".

            Try playing "ERA".
          you: "E -> 3,5"
          gets: "A"

            When an attack succeeds, all tiles touching the attack are removed, even if they were part of a surviving word.
