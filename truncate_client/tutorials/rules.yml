            In this game you are playing as blue.

            You can tell which colour you're playing by the colour of the tiles in your hand.

            You start the game by placing tiles beside your dock.

            Your dock is at the bottom left of the board. Try playing an 'M' there.

        - description: |-
            Once you've placed a tile, you can place tiles beside your dock or your existing tiles.

        - description: |-
            Place a 'G' to form the word 'GROWING', which will touch your opponent's town, and win the game.
