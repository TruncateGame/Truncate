            Rule change: Allow invalid secondary attackers
        - message: |-
            Originally, all attacking words had to be valid for an attack to succeed.
            
            From now on, only the strongest attacker matters, and an attack can succeed even if some attackers are invalid.
        - message: |-
            Now it should be easier for you to calculate whether an attack succeeds:
            
            If your strongest attacker beats the weakest defender, you win the attack.
        - description: |-
            Try playing "ENOUGH" and "EEX" against "FOUR".

            Originally this failed, now it will succeed.
          you: "E -> 6,5"
          gets: "I"
        - end_message: |-
            Since "ENOUGH" was long enough to beat "FOUR" it wins the battle, and "EEX" is irrelevant despite being invalid and too short.
